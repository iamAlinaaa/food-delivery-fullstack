# food-delivery-fullstack
The main idea of app is to help user to choose shop from several ones and products available in this shop (or in all shops), add them into cart, apply discount coupons if necessary and provide information to get order submitted. Users also can find theirs history of orders.
There are 4 pages available with different opportunities for user: 
* Main Page where all shops are listed;
* Cart Page, where user can order food, apply discount and find distance and time from shop to his/her home on map;
* History Page where user can find history of order/orders by entering user email; 
* Coupons Page where users may find good opportunities and discounts for their shopping and copy discount code to add it on Cart Page.
This app contains backend and frontend parts + database. For frontent I used React and backend is Node.js. As database I used MongoDB.
